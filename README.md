## 🛠 My Personal Settings

These are the settings I'm currently using in my code editor and terminal.

Feel free to copy whatever you find useful!

I recently migrated from Linux Mint Cinnamon to Ubuntu for compatibility reasons on the projects I'm working on.

All of the system setup I did is documented [here 🕵️‍♂️💻](./ubuntu-setup.md).
